# Biogeographic analysis with Julia
## Workshop materials

Notebooks and data for the participants in the "Biogeographic analysis with Julia"
at the International Biogeographic Society's biannual conference in Malaga, Spain
8. January 2018. I've stolen liberally and shamelessly from @crstnbr
(e.g. the entire Github.ipynb), @dpsanders (several parts in the introductory ipynb,
e.g. the text about multiple dispatch), @xorJane (e.g. the beginning of the
introductory workbook) and @yakir12 (the unitful example). Not all parts, e.g.
the DataFrames ipynb, are finished yet.
